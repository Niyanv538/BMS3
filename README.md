This is a Master Data Science group project focusing on prediction of housing sale prices in a small housing dataset. The original dataset was the The Real Estate Sales 2001–2022 dataset, which is a record of residential property transactions over twenty-two years (Masidekabakci, 2024). It includes raw sale prices (Sale.Amount), tax-assessed values (Assessed.Value), transaction dates, and various property attributes (e.g. location, size, year built). The data is grouped by time periods (e.g., months or years) and location coordinates. It is used/created for educational purposes for real estate analysis, or exploring patterns/models in property sales over time, but it is mostly useful for regression tasks in predicting sale amounts. However, it is not considered peer-reviewed, and no major papers have used this exact compilation, but similar datasets are used in the literature and Kaggle competitions. It is pulled from Kaggle, the link is:https://www.kaggle.com/code/masidekabakci/real-estate-sales-2001-2022.

Preprocessing steps we did include parsing the date field, handling or dropping missing values, converting categorical columns to factors, and (for modeling) log-transforming highly skewed columns like ‘sale_amount’ and ‘assessed_value’. We also converted the ‘Location’ column to two columns: ‘lon’ & ‘lat’, for the spatial GP model. Furthermore, we plotted the histogram of ’Sale_Amount. Lastly, we removed outliers outside the inter quartile range.

The goal was to implement and compare Bayesian models for prediction by selecting priors. Prior sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the models' predictons; posterior prediction checks showed how the predictions fit the data. K-fold cross-validation was used to compare the models, as well as RMSE and MAE as loss functions. Overall, based on the elpd_difference, Model 2 is chosen, but with only weak evidence and not being meaningfully better in predictive performance than the other models. Sale prices in this model rise almost proportionally with assessed value: a one-percent increase in the assessed figure translates into roughly a 0.8 percent increase in the expected sale price, so doubling the assessment more than doubles what a property is likely to fetch. By contrast, parcels classified as “Vacant” carry a clear penalty, selling for about eight percent less than comparable properties with the baseline use-code. The calendar year of listing hints at a two-percent annual upward drift in prices, but the wide uncertainty band around that estimate means the data do not rule out the possibility of no real trend at all. Seasonality shows an even smaller, statistically unclear effect, implying that when the property is listed within the year probably does not have much of an effect when taking other factors into account. The RSME and MAE loss functions were 123682.4 and 83957.06 respectively. For the sake of interpretation, we also included MAPE to understand the relative magnitude of the error, which was reported to be 62.3%.
